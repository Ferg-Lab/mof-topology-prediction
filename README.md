# mof-topology-prediction
This is a repository containing the supporting information, simulation utilities, and Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>-BDT MOF databank. The preprint of the paper is [here](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-swb7z)

## Databank_Iron-Sulfur-MOF
This is the library containing the equilibrated structures of the iron-sulfur BDT MOFs with different cations and the calculated energies and geometric properties reported in the paper. 
## automated_scripts
This includes python-based codes for MOF generation, cation deposition, equilibration, and free energy calculation. It is suitable for small-scale simulations and requires more attendance. Code implementations and tests are included in automated_scripts. 
## simulation_untilities
This is a high-throughput screening pipeline once all the input files and parameter files are generated. For more details, see the README in simulation_untilities.
